# First impressions

## Description
- Master - Detail view
- Data comes from network repository (Github Rest API)
- Retrofit like DIO client library needed
- Should work in both orientations

## UI
### Master View
- Listview
- Infinity scrool
- Item data:
    - title
    - number
    - creation date
    - author login
    - labels with the correct color
### Details View
- Issue information
- Item data:
    - title
    - number
    - creation date
    - author login
    - author avatar
    - labels with the correct color
    - description
	- only the text part is required
	- but fell free to go with markdown rendering, code highlight and images if you like

## TODOS
- Choose architecture (Clean architecture)
- Create UML plans (user stories, class diagrags, etc.)
- Plan load and error handling (If there is enough time: shimmer loading effect for both views separatly)
- Create DIO client for the query with TDD
- Choose state management
- Create wireframes/moqups
- Create Details View
- Create Master view
- Improve UX
